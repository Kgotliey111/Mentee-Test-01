# Beginner Python Test

This test is designed for **absolute and normal beginners** in Python.  
It should take **about one hour** to complete.

The test focuses on:
- Basic syntax
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Lists and strings
- Functions and return values

Each function in `fundamentals.py` has a **docstring** explaining what to do.  
You must **complete each function** so that all tests pass.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd beginner_python_test
   python -m unittest tests/fundamentals_tests.py
